# SexualMinorityDepression (SMD) Simulation

SMD is a simulation software used for modelling the effects of 
stigmas faced by sexual minorities in the forms of both social and 
administral discrimination. In particular, it seeks to answer the 
questions regarding their relative effects (comparing individual and network
forms of stigmatization) on depressive behaviors amongst the LGB community. 
In particular, we developed here an agent based model, concentrating on 
modelling concealment, depression, and policy passing. 

The output of the model consists of the following:
- Plots of the network after evolving over a specified length of time
- Sensitivity plots of the percentage of depressed sexual minority members
as functions of:
	- Policies (discriminatory/beneficial)
	- Supportive community
	- More/less LGB concentration

Note: The package uses Python 3, with the Numpy, NetworkX, and
Matplotlib libraries.
